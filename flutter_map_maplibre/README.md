# flutter_map_maplibre

This package offers performant Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) support
for [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map)
powered by native [MapLibre SDKs](https://maplibre.org).

## Features

There are two possibilities how to use bridge the gap between `flutter_map`
and `maplibre`:

- Add a MapLibre map as a layer to your FlutterMap map.
- Use FlutterMap layers in your MapLibre map.

## Getting started

Add the dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_map: ^7.0.0
  flutter_map_maplibre: ^0.0.1
  maplibre: ^0.1.0
```
