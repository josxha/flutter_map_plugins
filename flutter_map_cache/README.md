## Motivation

- Many tile providers **require users in their tile usage policy** to cache
  tile requests. This decreases the load on those servers and is important
  especially if they are donation based like the OpenStreetMap.
- Caching map tiles provides a **better user experience** since the region the
  user visited **loads nearby instantly**. Most of the time a user visits the
  same regions often, e.g. because it is the region he lives in.
- Especially raster tiles that are used by default on flutter_map, the data
  consumption can be high really fast. Caching tiles **lowers the amount of used
  mobile data and bandwidth** with itself is an enthusiasm factor you don't want
  to miss out on.

## Features

The package uses [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) with the
[dio_cache_interceptor](https://pub.dev/packages/dio_cache_interceptor) package
and supports the storage backend that
you like.

Supported storage backends are:

| Storage backend                                 | Description                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-Memory                                       | - For testing purposes<br/>- `flutter_map` has memory caching itself                                           |
| File System                                     | - Easy to setup, no additional storage backend package required<br/>- potentially slower than using a database |
| [Drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift)         | - SQLite database<br/>- good platform support                                                                  |
| [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)           | - key-value database<br/>- easy to integrate                                                                   |
| [ObjectBox](https://pub.dev/packages/objectbox) | - NoSQL, ACID compliant<br/>- Fast library<br/>- More complex integration                                      |
| [Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar)           | - NoSQL<br/>- Fast library<br/>- More complex integration                                                      |

Other storage backends will be supported as soon as the underlying package
[dio_cache_interceptor](https://pub.dev/packages/dio_cache_interceptor) supports
them.

## Getting started

1. Add the packages you want to use to your `pubspec.yaml` file. Only add the
   packages for the backend you want to use.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_map: ^6.0.0 # in case you don't have it yet 
  flutter_map_cache: ^1.3.0 # this package
  path_provider: ^2.1.2 # in case the storage backend requires a path

  # drift
  dio_cache_interceptor_db_store: ^5.1.0
  sqlite3_flutter_libs: ^0.5.15

  # file system
  dio_cache_interceptor_file_store: ^1.2.2

  # hive
  dio_cache_interceptor_hive_store: ^3.2.1

  # objectbox
  dio_cache_interceptor_objectbox_store: ^1.1.3
  objectbox_flutter_libs: ^1.4.1

  # isar
  isar: ^3.1.0+1
  isar_flutter_libs: ^3.1.0+1
```

2. ⚠️ Some storage backends have their own required setups. Please check them
   out in their package documentations.

## Usage

Using the cache is easy. Here are examples how to use some of the storage
backends:

### Hive

<details open>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

1. First get the cache directory of the app (i.e. with
   the [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
   package).

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

Future<String> getPath() async {
  final cacheDirectory = await getTemporaryDirectory();
  return cacheDirectory.path;
}
```

2. Then use the directory path to initialize the `HiveCacheStore`. You can wrap
   FlutterMap inside a `FutureBuilder` to use
   the `getPath()` method.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return FlutterMap(
    options: MapOptions(),
    children: [
      TileLayer(
        urlTemplate: 'https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
        tileProvider: CachedTileProvider(
          // maxStale keeps the tile cached for the given Duration and 
          // tries to revalidate the next time it gets requested
          maxStale: const Duration(days: 30),
          store: HiveCacheStore(
            path,
            hiveBoxName: 'HiveCacheStore',
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

### In Memory (for testing)

class MyMap extends StatelessWidget {
  MyMap({super.key});

  // create the cache store as a field variable
  final _cacheStore = MemCacheStore();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlutterMap(
      options: MapOptions(),
      children: [
        TileLayer(
          urlTemplate: 'https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
          tileProvider: CachedTileProvider(
            // use the store for your CachedTileProvider instance
            store: _cacheStore,
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );

### More examples

You can find additional example implementations for other storage backends in
[the example app](https://github.com/josxha/flutter_map_plugins/tree/main/example)
on GitHub.

## Common use cases & frequent questions

### How about web?

<details>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

This package supports the web as long as you use a storage backend that supports
web.

- In Memory works out of the box
- Hive uses for its web support IndexedDB under the hood to support web.
- Drift (SqLite)
  requires [additional setup steps for web](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/web/)

### Does this package support cancellation of tile requests?

<details>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

Yes. This package includes the tile cancellation out of the box.
There is no need
for [flutter_map_cancellable_tile_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map_cancellable_tile_provider/)
when using
this package.

</details>

### Remove the api key from the url before it gets used for caching

<details>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

Commercial tile providers often use an api key that is attached as a parameter
to the url. While this shouldn't be a problem when the api key stays the same
you might want to make it immune to api key changes anyway.

```
final _uuid = Uuid();

CachedTileProvider(
  keyBuilder: (request) {
    return _uuid.v5(
      Uuid.NAMESPACE_URL,
      request.uri.replace(queryParameters: {}).toString(),
    );
  },
),
```

</details>

### How about pre-downloading, bulk-downloading or offline map?

<details>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

This package does not provide support to download tiles automatically.
Only tiles that were previously visited with an active internet connection
show up on the map.

⚠️ Please note that free tile providers such as
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) forbids bulk
downloading (more than 250 tiles on a higher zoom level) of tiles in their
[tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/).
If you use a paid tile provider, bulk-downloading can cause high costs if
you pay per tile request. Using a proper offline map solution
(e.g. MBTiles or PMTiles) would be my recommendation here.

If you still need bulk-downloading functionality you can check out the package
[flutter_map_tile_caching](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map_tile_caching)
(Paid license is needed or your project has to be open sourced under the
GPL-3.0 license).

### What if I want to use sqflite?

<details>
  <summary>Click here to expand / hide.</summary>

Because [dio_cache_interceptor](https://github.com/llfbandit/dio_cache_interceptor)
already supports Drift as a SQLite solution it's unlikely that `sqflite` will
be supported any day soon.

If you still are required to use only sqflite, I recommend to create your own
tile provider by using the
[cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) package.
